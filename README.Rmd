# boxrdrive

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of boxrdrive is to make it easier to access Box from your *local* computer, using [Box Drive](https://www.box.com/drive). This may be useful in institutional settings, where you may not have access to a [Box App](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/articles/boxr-apps.html), which you would need to be able to use [boxr](https://r-box.github.io/boxr/).

The general idea of Box Drive is to provide you access to your Box files as a native part of your computer's filesystem; it relies on the same authentication method your institution provides when you log into the Box web portal.

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN; you can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
